## Local Development

Before starting development on LobeChat, you need to install and configure some necessary software and tools in your local environment. This document will guide you through these steps.

### Development Environment Requirements

First, you need to install the following software:

- Node.js: LobeChat is built on Node.js, so you need to install Node.js. We recommend installing the latest stable version.
- PNPM: We use PNPM as the preferred package manager. You can download and install it from the [PNPM official website](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Bun: We use Bun as the npm scripts runner. You can download and install it from the [Bun official website](https://bun.com/docs/installation).
- Git: We use Git for version control. You can download and install it from the Git official website.
- IDE: You can choose your preferred integrated development environment (IDE). We recommend using WebStorm/VSCode.

### VSCode Users

We recommend installing the extensions listed in [.vscode/extensions.json](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json) for the best development experience.

### Project Setup

After installing the above software, you can start setting up the LobeChat project.

1. **Get the code**: First, you need to clone the LobeChat codebase from GitHub. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**: Then, navigate to the project directory and use PNPM to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
cd lobe-chat
pnpm i
```

3. **Start the development server**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Now, you can open `http://localhost:3010` in your browser, and you should see the welcome page of LobeChat. This indicates that you have successfully set up the development environment.
